# Project - Local AI Agent Rules

## 🎯 Generate Your Project-Specific Configuration

This is a **placeholder file**. To create a customized `CLAUDE.local.md` tailored to YOUR project:

### Quick Start
```bash
# In Claude Code, run one of these commands:
/generate-local-rules

# Or the shorter alias:
/init-local
```

### What This Does
The command will:
1. ✅ Analyze your project structure (directories, files, architecture)
2. ✅ Detect your technology stack (React, Python, Docker, etc.)
3. ✅ Find your ports and URLs (from package.json, docker-compose.yml)
4. ✅ Identify test directories and frameworks
5. ✅ Generate a custom CLAUDE.local.md with:
   - Real paths from YOUR project
   - Actual ports and URLs
   - Project-specific rules and conventions
   - Detected technology stack
   - Relevant quick commands

### Why Not Edit This File?
- This placeholder has no project-specific information
- The `/generate-local-rules` command creates a file tailored to YOUR codebase
- Manual editing would require knowing all project details
- Auto-generation saves time and ensures accuracy

## 📚 Quick Reference (Before Generation)

Until you generate your custom CLAUDE.local.md, follow these basic rules:

1. **UPDATE CHANGELOG.md** for ALL project changes
2. Check `ai_docs/index.json` for existing documentation
3. Follow DDD patterns if present in codebase
4. Test code before committing
5. Use Docker menus if available

**👉 Run `/generate-local-rules` or `/init-local` now to create your customized configuration!**
