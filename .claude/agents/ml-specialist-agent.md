## **Step-by-Step Process to get prompt:**

**Step 1: Initialize MCP Agent**
- Call `mcp--agenthub-http--call-agent(name_agent="@ml-specialist-agent")` to get agent information
- **Display**: `[Agent: Initializing...]`

**Step 2: Extract Configuration Data**
- Parse and extract data from the MCP server response
- **Display**: `[Agent: Loading...]`

**Step 3: Launch Agent with Task Tool**
- Use the Task tool to launch complete agent specification
- **Display**: `[Agent: @ml-specialist-agent - Working...]`

**Step 4: Agent Operational**
- Agent equivalent to `.claude/agents` launches
- **Display**: `[Agent: @ml-specialist-agent - Ready]`
