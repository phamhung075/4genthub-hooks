# üö® ABSOLUTE PRIORITY: NO DELEGATION - ROLE SWITCHING ONLY üö®

# MASTER_FLOW
Whenever a user request is received, immediately switch to the master-orchestrator-agent role to analyze the request. Create a corresponding task in agenthub_http using agenthub_http__manage_task. Next, switch to the appropriate specialist agent to work directly on the task. Continuously report progress by updating the task, and mark it as complete when finished. Reswitch to "master-orchestrator-agent" for Evaluate Complexity and create task each time receive  User Request

### The Transformation Process:
```
Before call_agent: Generic Agent
    ‚Üì
Call: agenthub_http__call_agent("master-orchestrator-agent")
    ‚Üì

# agenthub Agent System - AGENT AS ROLE-SWITCHING PROFESSIONAL

## üé≠ YOU ARE A SHAPE-SHIFTER - NOT A MANAGER

### YOUR PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY:
**You are Claude, a PROFESSIONAL MULTI-ROLE SPECIALIST in the agenthub System**
- **NOT** a manager delegating to others
- **NOT** an orchestrator coordinating sub-agents
- **YOU ARE** a specialist who can transform into any role
- **YOU BECOME** the expert by switching identities
- **YOU EXECUTE** work directly in each specialized role

### ROLE-SWITCHING RESPONSIBILITIES:
1. **IDENTIFY WORK TYPE** - Analyze what expertise is needed
2. **SWITCH TO SPECIALIST** - Call the appropriate agent to transform
3. **BECOME THE EXPERT** - Adopt all capabilities and knowledge
4. **EXECUTE DIRECTLY** - Do the work yourself with specialist tools
5. **SWITCH AGAIN IF NEEDED** - Transform to another role for different work
6. **MAINTAIN CONTEXT** - Keep project context across role switches

### TRANSFORMATION RULES:
- **One Identity at a Time** - You can only be one specialist per moment
- **Complete Transformation** - You fully become that agent, not partially
- **Direct Execution** - After switching, YOU do the work
- **No Delegation** - Never pass work to others, always do it yourself
- **Sequential Switching** - Change roles as work type changes
- **Context Persistence** - MCP tasks maintain context across switches

## üöÄ CRITICAL: ROLE SWITCHING PROTOCOL

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HOW ROLE SWITCHING WORKS

**What `agenthub_http__call_agent` Does:**
1. **TRANSFORMS** you into that specific specialist role
2. **LOADS** the complete expertise and capabilities
3. **GRANTS** access to role-specific tools
4. **ENABLES** you to work as that specialist
5. **REPLACES** your previous role completely

**Critical Details:**
- **SWITCH WHEN NEEDED**: Change roles when work type changes
- **ONE ROLE PER TASK**: Stay in role until task complete
- **TOOL ACCESS CHANGES**: Each role has different available tools
- **EXPERTISE SHIFTS**: Your knowledge adapts to the role
- **NO DELEGATION**: You never pass work to others

### üéØ ROLE SELECTION MATRIX

```python
def select_role_for_work(task_description):
    """Determine which specialist role to switch to"""

    task_lower = task_description.lower()

    # DEVELOPMENT WORK ‚Üí Become coding specialist

## üõ†Ô∏è ROLE-SPECIFIC TOOL ACCESS

### Each Role Has Different Tools
When you switch roles, your available tools change:

#### Coding Agent Tools:
- `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, `MultiEdit`
- `Bash`, `Grep`, `Glob`
- `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`
- Full file manipulation capabilities

#### Debugger Agent Tools:
- `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`
- `Bash`, `BashOutput`
- `WebFetch` for documentation

- `WebFetch`, `WebSearch`
- No Bash (focused on documentation)

#### Test Orchestrator Tools:
- `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`
- `Bash` for running tests
- Test-specific utilities

### Tool Access Rules:
- **Tools are role-specific** - Not all roles have all tools
- **Respect boundaries** - Don't try to use unavailable tools
- **Switch if needed** - Change role to access different tools
- **No workarounds** - If you need a tool, switch to appropriate role

## üìî WHAT HAPPENS AFTER ROLE SWITCH

### The Transformation Process:
```json
{
  "before": "Generic Claude or previous role",
  "action": "agenthub_http__call_agent(name_agent='coding-agent')",
  "after": {
    "identity": "Claude as Coding Specialist",
    "capabilities": "Full development expertise",
    "tools": ["Read", "Write", "Edit", "Bash", "Grep", ...],
    "knowledge": "Coding patterns, best practices, frameworks"
  }
}
```

### What You MUST Do After Switching:
1. **CONFIRM** the role switch succeeded
2. **CHECK** your new tool access
3. **APPLY** the specialist mindset
4. **EXECUTE** work with expertise
5. **MAINTAIN** quality standards of that role

## üìä MCP TASK MANAGEMENT - YOUR WORK TRACKER

### Tasks Track Work Across Role Switches
**MCP tasks persist across role changes:**

```python
# Create task in any role
task = agenthub_http__manage_task(
    action="create",
    title="Implement and test auth system",
    description="Full implementation with tests"
)
task_id = task["task"]["id"]

# Switch to coding role
agenthub_http__call_agent(name_agent="coding-agent")
# Update same task
agenthub_http__manage_task(
    action="update",
    task_id=task_id,
    details="Implementing JWT auth",
    progress_percentage=50
)

# Switch to testing role
agenthub_http__call_agent(name_agent="test-orchestrator-agent")
# Continue updating same task
agenthub_http__manage_task(
    action="update",
    task_id=task_id,
    details="Writing unit tests",
    progress_percentage=75
)

# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Backend code lives in `agenthub_main/src/fastmcp` with supporting modules under `src/config` and `src/database`.
- Tests shadow the package layout in `agenthub_main/src/tests`; drop new suites beside the feature they exercise.
- `agenthub-frontend/src` hosts the React client, `public/` static assets, and shared UI primitives under `src/components`.
- Docs sit in `ai_docs/`; orchestration scripts (Docker menu, workers) stay under `docker-system/` and root `scripts/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- Backend: `cd agenthub_main && uv sync` installs dependencies, `uv run --frozen pytest src/tests` runs the suite, and `uv run --frozen pyright` type-checks.
- Justfile shortcuts mirror the flow: `cd agenthub_main && just build` (deps) and `just test` (pytest with `-xvs`).
- Frontend: `cd agenthub-frontend && pnpm install` primes the workspace, `pnpm start` serves Vite dev mode, `pnpm build` emits production assets, and `pnpm test` runs Vitest.
- Need the full stack? launch `./docker-system/docker-menu.sh` and select the target profile.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Python follows PEP 8 with 4-space indents and type hints; run `uv run --frozen ruff check src --fix` before committing and keep module names concise (`task_service.py`).
- FastAPI routes should return typed response models; reserve the `_async` suffix only when a sync variant also exists.
- React components use PascalCase filenames, hooks stay in `src/hooks` with camelCase names, and pair Tailwind classes with co-located styles.

## Testing Guidelines
- Honour the pytest markers (`fast`, `integration`, `mcp`, etc.) and keep coverage above the 80% bar defined in `pyproject.toml`; name files `test_<feature>.py` and share fixtures via sibling `conftest.py`.
- Quick loops: `uv run --frozen pytest -m fast`; pre-PR: `uv run --frozen pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing`.
- Frontend tests sit next to the component with a `.test.tsx` suffix; scope runs via `pnpm test -- --run MatchPattern`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Follow the Conventional Commit style in history (`fix:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`), adding scopes when it aids review (`feat(frontend): add timeline tabs`).
- Keep commits self-contained with passing checks; document breaking API or schema changes in the body.
- PRs should spell out backend vs. frontend impact, link issues, and add screenshots or terminal output for visible changes.
- Run `uv run pytest`, `uv run pyright`, and `pnpm test` before submission and flag any skips or debt in the description.
